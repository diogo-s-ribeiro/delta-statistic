In this repository you can download code of the delta statistic, that is:

(delta-python)
A python file with pertinent code that can be run directly;

(delta-webapp)
A Django web application code that can be deployed localy in your machine. 
To do so, you should change "DEBUG = True", apply a random "SECRET_KEY" and add your domain to "ALLOWED_HOSTS".

There are currently also (free) websites that are deploying this webapplication. They can be found at:
